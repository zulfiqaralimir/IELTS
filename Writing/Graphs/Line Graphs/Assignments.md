The line graph illustrates the average monthly fluctuations in the prices of copper, nickel, and zinc throughout the year 2014. 

Overall, copper experienced the most volatility, with prices both rising and falling significantly over the year. Nickel and zinc showed less dramatic changes, and generally decreased in price over the period.

Copper started the year with a sharp increase of nearly 6%, followed by a gradual decline to around -2% by mid-year. From July onwards, copper rebounded, ending the year slightly above its starting price.

Nickel began 2014 with a more modest increase compared to copper, but then steadily declined throughout the year. By December, nickel prices had fallen by over 2% from their starting point.

Zinc showed the least change of the three metals. After a small rise in January, zinc prices decreased gradually until August. They then fluctuated slightly before finishing the year close to their starting price. 

In summary, while all three metals experienced price changes throughout 2014, copper was the most volatile, nickel showed a general decline, and zinc remained relatively stable. 


Based on the provided response, the estimated IELTS Writing Task 1 band score would likely be in the range of 7.0 to 7.5.

Here's a breakdown of why:

**Task Achievement:** The response effectively addresses all key features of the graph, providing a clear overview and summarizing the main trends for each metal. The information is presented logically and coherently.

**Coherence and Cohesion:** The use of cohesive devices (e.g., "overall," "while," "in summary") and linking words (e.g., "then," "followed by") ensures smooth transitions between sentences and paragraphs, enhancing the overall flow of the text.

**Lexical Resource:** The vocabulary used is appropriate for the task, demonstrating a good range of words and phrases related to describing trends and changes (e.g., "volatility," "fluctuated," "rebounded"). There are no significant errors in word choice or usage.

**Grammatical Range and Accuracy:** The sentences are well-structured, and a variety of grammatical structures are used (e.g., simple, complex, and compound sentences). There are few, if any, grammatical errors, indicating a high level of accuracy.

**Overall:** The response effectively communicates the information from the graph in a clear, concise, and well-organized manner. It demonstrates a good command of English language skills, including vocabulary, grammar, and coherence.

**Areas for Improvement:** While the response is already strong, there is always room for improvement. For example, the writer could try to incorporate more complex sentence structures or include a wider range of vocabulary to further enhance the lexical resource. 

**Note:** This is just an estimated band score. The actual score given by an IELTS examiner might vary slightly depending on the specific marking criteria and the individual examiner's judgment.
