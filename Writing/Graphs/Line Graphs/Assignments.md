The line graph illustrates the average monthly fluctuations in the prices of copper, nickel, and zinc throughout the year 2014. 

Overall, copper experienced the most volatility, with prices both rising and falling significantly over the year. Nickel and zinc showed less dramatic changes, and generally decreased in price over the period.

Copper started the year with a sharp increase of nearly 6%, followed by a gradual decline to around -2% by mid-year. From July onwards, copper rebounded, ending the year slightly above its starting price.

Nickel began 2014 with a more modest increase compared to copper, but then steadily declined throughout the year. By December, nickel prices had fallen by over 2% from their starting point.

Zinc showed the least change of the three metals. After a small rise in January, zinc prices decreased gradually until August. They then fluctuated slightly before finishing the year close to their starting price. 

In summary, while all three metals experienced price changes throughout 2014, copper was the most volatile, nickel showed a general decline, and zinc remained relatively stable.
