## PML-N’s Ahsan Iqbal decries Swat mob lynching *(Hanging;Mob justice;Vigilante justice;Extra-judicial execution)*, demands committee to probe vigilantism
Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal on Saturday condemned the lynching of a man in Swat, *lamenting* how religion is being weaponised to justify “street justice” and “vigilantism”.


In The Coming Wave, Mustafa Suleyman, the co-founder of DeepMind, offers a **captivating exploration** of the **transformative power** and **inherent dangers** of artificial intelligence (AI) and synthetic biology. He **unveils** a future where humanity **grapples with** both the **extraordinary potential and the existential risks** of these technologies. Join us as we delve into the depths of this **thought-provoking book**, examining the **delicate balance between progress and peril**, and the **urgent need to contain the coming wave** to ensure a future that benefits all of humanity.

In The Coming Wave, Mustafa Suleyman concludes that the challenges posed by the coming wave of technology are **immense**, but they **are not insurmountable**. He **advocates** for a **proactive and collaborative approach** to shape the **development and deployment** of these technologies, emphasizing the importance of **technological containment**. Suleyman believes that by prioritizing safety, ethics, and responsible innovation, humanity can navigate the risks and **harness the benefits** of AI and synthetic biology to create a more **prosperous and equitable future**. He calls for a **collective effort** involving technologists, policymakers, and the public to ensure that these powerful tools are used for good and do not lead to **catastrophic or dystopian outcomes**. The author remains optimistic, emphasizing that while the **challenges are significant**, the potential rewards of harnessing these technologies responsibly are **immense**.

The book advocates for a **multi-pronged approach** to contain the threat of emerging technologies. These strategies include:

### Technical Safety: 
Implementing **robust safety measures** in AI and synthetic biology to prevent misuse and accidents. This involves developing secure systems, **rigorous testing protocols**, and "off switches" to shut down systems if they pose a threat.
### Audits: 
Ensuring **transparency and accountability** in **developing and deploying** these technologies. This includes regular audits of AI models and systems, as well as the creation of government-funded "red teams" to proactively **identify vulnerabilities**.
### Choke Points: 
Identifying and controlling critical points in the technology supply chain to manage the pace of development and **mitigate risks**. This could involve export controls, regulations on access to key resources, and licensing requirements for developing and deploying certain technologies.
### Responsible Development: 
Encouraging developers to prioritize safety and ethics in their work. This involves promoting a culture of responsibility within the tech industry and establishing ethical guidelines for AI and synthetic biology research.
### New Business Models: 
Creating new business models that incentivize safety and social responsibility alongside profit. This could involve developing new corporate structures that prioritize social impact and establishing financial incentives for companies that prioritize safety and ethical considerations.
### Government Regulation: 
Strengthening the government's role in regulating and overseeing the development and use of these technologies. This includes establishing clear regulations and standards for AI and synthetic biology, as well as creating new government agencies or departments to oversee these technologies.
### International Cooperation: 
**Fostering international collaboration** to establish global norms and standards for the safe and ethical use of AI and synthetic biology. This could involve creating international treaties and agreements to regulate these technologies and establishing global monitoring and enforcement mechanisms.
### Cultural Change: 
Promoting a culture of responsibility and accountability within the tech industry and among the public. This involves raising awareness of the potential risks of these technologies and encouraging open **dialogue and debate** about their ethical implications.
### Public Engagement: 
Encouraging public participation in discussions about the risks and benefits of these technologies. This could involve holding public consultations and hearings, creating citizen assemblies to deliberate on these issues, and providing educational resources to help the public understand the **implications** of these technologies.
By implementing these measures, the book suggests that it may be possible to mitigate the risks associated with emerging technologies and ensure that they are used for the benefit of humanity.
