## Compound vs Complex Sentences
In everyday conversations, people often mix these sentence structures naturally to convey their thoughts clearly and effectively. The key is to use them appropriately based on the relationship between ideas you want to express. Using a mix of compound and complex sentences helps to vary sentence structure, *making your speech more interesting and nuanced.*

### Compound Sentences (Coordinating Conjunction)(Independent Clauses):

* **I wanted to go for a run, but it started raining heavily.**

This is a compound sentence because it consists of two independent clauses (I wanted to go for a run and it started raining heavily) joined by the coordinating conjunction "but."

* **he enjoys playing tennis, and he prefers swimming.**

Here, "She enjoys playing tennis" and "he prefers swimming" are two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction "and."

* **The movie was entertaining, yet it didn't live up to my expectations.**

"The movie was entertaining" and "it didn't live up to my expectations" are two independent clauses connected by the coordinating conjunction "yet."


### Complex Sentences (Subordinating Conjunction)(Independent and Dependent Clause):

* **Although she studied hard, she didn't pass the exam.**

This is a complex sentence where "Although she studied hard" is a dependent clause (subordinate clause) and "she didn't pass the exam" is an independent clause. 
They are joined by the subordinating conjunction "although."

* **He couldn't attend the meeting because he was sick.**

In this complex sentence, "He couldn't attend the meeting" is the independent clause, and "because he was sick" is the dependent clause that explains the reason. The dependent clause begins with the subordinating conjunction "because."

* **Since it was late, we decided to stay overnight.**

"Since it was late" is the dependent clause (subordinate clause), and "we decided to stay overnight" is the independent clause. They are connected by the subordinating conjunction "since."

## Coordinating Conjunctions:

### For  And  Nor  But Or Yet  So

## Subordinating Conjunctions:
