## Compound vs Complex Sentences

### Compound Sentences:

* **I wanted to go for a run, but it started raining heavily.**

This is a compound sentence because it consists of two independent clauses (I wanted to go for a run and it started raining heavily) joined by the coordinating conjunction "but."

* **he enjoys playing tennis, and he prefers swimming.**

Here, "She enjoys playing tennis" and "he prefers swimming" are two independent clauses joined by the coordinating conjunction "and."

* **The movie was entertaining, yet it didn't live up to my expectations.**

"The movie was entertaining" and "it didn't live up to my expectations" are two independent clauses connected by the coordinating conjunction "yet."
