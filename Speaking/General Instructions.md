**Speaking**

This test takes between 11 and 14 minutes and is conducted by a trained examiner. There are three parts:

**Part 1**
The candidate and the examiner introduce themselves. Candidates then answer general questions about themselves, their home/family, their job/studies, their interests, and various similar familiar topic areas. This part lasts between four and five minutes.

**Part 2**
The candidate is given a task card with prompts and is asked to talk on a particular topic. The candidate has one minute to prepare and can make some notes if they wish, before speaking for between one and two minutes. The examiner then asks one or two questions on the same topic.

**Part 3**
The examiner and the candidate engage in a discussion of more abstract issues thematically linked to the topic in Part 2. The discussion lasts between four and five minutes.

The Speaking test assesses whether candidates can communicate effectively in English. The assessment takes into account Fluency and Coherence, Lexical Resource, Grammatical Range and Accuracy, and Pronunciation. More information on assessing the Speaking test, including Speaking assessment criteria (public version), is available at ielts.org.

## Fluency
Fluency refers to the ability to express oneself easily and articulately. In language learning, fluency is often associated with the smooth and rapid production of speech or writing without undue hesitation or pausing. Key characteristics of fluency include:

Ease of Expression: Being able to convey thoughts without struggle.
Flow of Speech or Writing: Producing language in a continuous, uninterrupted manner.
Speed and Smoothness: Speaking or writing at a natural pace, without frequent pauses or corrections.
Accuracy: While fluency emphasizes smoothness and speed, it also encompasses a reasonable level of grammatical correctness.

## Coherence
Coherence pertains to the logical and orderly presentation of ideas in a way that makes them easily understandable to the audience. It involves the clarity and logical structure of the content. Key characteristics of coherence include:

Logical Organization: Ideas are presented in a structured, logical sequence.
Clear Connections: The relationships between sentences and paragraphs are clearly marked, often using transition words and phrases.
Relevance: All parts of the speech or text contribute to the main topic or argument.
Consistency: The tone, style, and terminology are consistent throughout the communication.

## Relationship Between Fluency and Coherence
While fluency and coherence are distinct, they are interrelated. A fluent speaker or writer may produce language smoothly, but if the content is not coherent, the message may be difficult to understand. Conversely, a coherent presentation of ideas that is disjointed and halting can also hinder effective communication. Ideally, effective communication balances both fluency and coherence, allowing the speaker or writer to convey ideas clearly, logically, and smoothly.
